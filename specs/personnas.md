# User Personas: Theme Camp Hub

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-10

## Introduction

These personas represent the primary user types for the Theme Camp Hub application during its initial MVP phase, focusing on single-camp usage. They help guide design and development decisions by grounding them in the needs, goals, and contexts of real users involved in the often complex and demanding process of organizing and participating in a Burning Man theme camp.

## Alex (Camp Organizer / Overall Lead)

* **Playa Name:** Sparky
* **Role:** Co-Lead Organizer for "The Shifting Sands Saloon" camp (Approx. 50 members).
* **Age:** 38
* **Occupation:** Project Manager
* **Burning Man Experience:** 8 Burns, 5th year organizing this camp.

### Background

Alex *loves* Burning Man and the community their camp creates, but the organizational overhead leading up to it is intense. They are reasonably tech-savvy, comfortable with spreadsheets and project management tools, but find coordinating dozens of volunteers with varying levels of commitment and tech skills exhausting. They spend *way* too much time in spreadsheets, email chains, and chat threads trying to keep everything straight. They are the final decision-maker on most things and feel the weight of responsibility for the camp's success and safety.

### Motivations

* To create an amazing, memorable experience for camp members.
* To foster a sense of community and participation within the camp.
* To reduce personal stress and administrative burnout during the planning phase.
* To ensure the camp runs smoothly and safely on playa.
* To *finally* have one place to find critical information instead of searching five different platforms.

### Goals (App-Related - MVP)

* Quickly see who is confirmed for camp and view their essential details (arrival/departure, accommodation needs for placement planning).
* Reliably communicate important updates to the entire camp via announcements.
* Delegate responsibility clearly by creating task lists and assigning specific tasks to Functional Leads or members.
* Track progress on major camp preparation tasks (build, transport, etc.).
* Have a central repository for key lists (shopping, packing suggestions) that isn't a perpetually outdated spreadsheet.
* Easily access summarized data for planning (e.g., total number of tents vs RVs, how many people arriving during build week).

### Frustrations (Current Planning)

* Information silos: Roster in one spreadsheet, tasks in another, announcements lost in chat history, accommodation details gathered via email...
* Constantly answering the same questions repeatedly because members can't find the info.
* Tracking down who owns which task and whether it's actually done.
* Trying to visualize camp layout based on scattered information about who is bringing what type of structure.
* The sheer volume of communication across different channels (email, Signal, Facebook group).
* Forgetting critical details because there's no single source of truth.

### Typical App Usage Scenarios (MVP)

* **(June):** Logging in to review the Roster, checking how many people have confirmed and updated their Accommodation Details. Sending a reminder announcement about updating profiles.
* **(July):** Creating Task Lists for "Build Week Prep" and "Kitchen Setup", assigning core tasks to the Build Lead (Jordan) and Kitchen Lead.
* **(August, pre-playa):** Posting an urgent Announcement: "Final call for shared transport - check the Rideshare status in your profile!". Reviewing the Accommodation Report to finalize the generator placement plan.
* **(On Playa - via intermittent connection/future offline):** Quickly looking up someone's playa name or arrival details (future goal). Posting a critical update if needed.

## Jordan (Functional Lead - e.g., Build Lead)

* **Playa Name:** Gadget
* **Role:** Build Lead for "The Shifting Sands Saloon".
* **Age:** 32
* **Occupation:** Carpenter / Maker
* **Burning Man Experience:** 5 Burns, 2nd year as Build Lead.

### Background

Jordan is hands-on and loves the challenge of building the camp's structures on playa. They are good at managing small teams in person but less organized with digital communication. They get frustrated when plans change last minute because information wasn't communicated clearly or tasks weren't tracked properly. They often rely on Alex for the big picture but want autonomy within their build domain. They might use a smartphone for basic communication but aren't glued to spreadsheets.

### Motivations

* To successfully build and strike all camp infrastructure safely and efficiently.
* To have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what during build/strike.
* To ensure they have the necessary materials and volunteer power when needed.
* To contribute their skills effectively to the camp's success.
* To avoid on-playa "oh crap" moments where a critical task was forgotten.

### Goals (App-Related - MVP)

* View and manage Task Lists specifically related to Build and Strike.
* Easily see who is assigned to which build task and mark tasks as complete.
* Access the camp Roster to see who has relevant skills (if captured in profile) or when key build volunteers are arriving.
* View Accommodation details (sizes, types) to help Alex plan the physical layout of structures vs. personal tents/RVs.
* Receive important Announcements from Alex regarding overall camp logistics that impact build (e.g., generator delivery time).
* Access shared Shopping Lists related to build supplies.

### Frustrations (Current Planning)

* Task lists getting lost or becoming outdated in shared documents.
* Not knowing who is actually showing up for a specific build shift.
* Verbal agreements about tasks getting forgotten.
* Last-minute scrambles for materials because the shopping list wasn't clear or updated.
* Difficulty communicating task status back up to Alex efficiently.

### Typical App Usage Scenarios (MVP)

* **(July):** Reviewing the "Build Task List" created by Alex. Breaking down larger tasks into sub-tasks and assigning them to specific build crew members (Sam and others). Adding items needed to the "Build Supplies" Shopping List.
* **(August):** Checking the Roster to see confirmed arrival times for the core build crew. Marking pre-playa build tasks (like "Cut Shade Structure Poles") as complete.
* **(On Playa - via intermittent connection/future offline):** Pulling up the Task List on their phone during build week to see what's next and mark completed tasks.

## Sam (Camp Member)

* **Playa Name:** Stardust
* **Role:** General Camp Member at "The Shifting Sands Saloon".
* **Age:** 27
* **Occupation:** Graphic Designer
* **Burning Man Experience:** 2nd Burn, 1st year with this camp.

### Background

Sam is excited to be part of a more organized camp this year after a chaotic first burn experience. They want to contribute but sometimes feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and unsure where to find answers. They are comfortable using web and mobile apps. They want to feel connected to the camp community pre-playa and know what's expected of them.

### Motivations

* To have a smooth and enjoyable Burn experience.
* To connect with campmates and feel part of the community.
* To understand their responsibilities (tasks, packing) clearly.
* To easily find logistical information (schedule - future, where things are - future).
* To contribute meaningfully to the camp's success.

### Goals (App-Related - MVP)

* Easily update their own Profile with Travel Itinerary and Accommodation Details so Alex/Jordan know their plans and needs.
* Read camp-wide Announcements to stay informed about important updates.
* View the Roster to put playa names to faces (or vice-versa) and see who else is coming.
* Check assigned Tasks (e.g., "Help unload truck Tuesday PM", "Decorate Saloon sign") and mark them complete.
* Access shared Lists like the suggested Packing List or a Potluck sign-up list (if created).

### Frustrations (Current Planning / Past Experience)

* Missing important announcements buried in long chat threads.
* Not knowing who to ask about specific things.
* Unclear expectations about participation or tasks.
* Having to update arrival time or accommodation plans in multiple places (or forgetting to).
* Difficulty finding essential info like "What time is the all-camp meeting?".

### Typical App Usage Scenarios (MVP)

* **(June):** Logging in after getting an invite, filling out their Profile including Accommodation ("Medium Tent, no power needed") and Travel ("Arriving Tuesday late afternoon, got my VP").
* **(July):** Checking the Dashboard for recent Announcements from Alex. Looking at the "Camp Packing Suggestions" List.
* **(August):** Getting a notification (future feature) or seeing on the dashboard that Jordan assigned them the task "Help Assemble Kitchen Shade Structure - Wednesday AM". Checking the task details.
* **(September, post-playa):** Updating profile if contact info changed. (Future: Participating in social features, viewing photos).

## Future User Considerations

As the platform evolves towards multitenancy and social features, additional personas/roles will become important:

* **Multi-Camp User:** Needs seamless switching between camp contexts.
* **Non-Attending Member / Alumnus:** Needs access focused on community updates and social interaction, not event logistics.
* **Camp Guest:** Limited, perhaps view-only access.
* **Platform Administrator:** Manages the overall SaaS service, tenants, and billing.
