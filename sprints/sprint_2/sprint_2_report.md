# Sprint 2 Report: Core UI Layout & Profile Structure

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-11
**Sprint Goal:** Implement main layout components and the basic Profile page structure.

---

## Summary of Activities

Sprint 2 focused on establishing the main application layout and building the initial structure for the User Profile feature.

1.  **Data Types & Mock Context:**
    *   Defined initial data types (`User`, `Profile`, `TravelItinerary`, `AccommodationDetails`, `Role`, `Camp`, `Membership`) in `src/types/dataModel.ts` based on specs.
    *   Created `UserContext.tsx` and `CampContext.tsx` with simple providers holding mock user ('Sam Stardust', MEMBER) and camp ('The Shifting Sands Saloon') data.
    *   Wrapped the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) with these context providers.

2.  **Core Layout Components:**
    *   Created `Header.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, and `Footer.tsx` in `src/components/layout/`.
    *   Implemented basic structure and styling for Header (with logo/title placeholder, user menu using Avatar/Button), Sidebar (with placeholder nav links), and Footer.
    *   Added necessary Shadcn components (`Button`, `Avatar`) via CLI.
    *   Resolved linter errors related to unused/missing imports during component creation.

3.  **Authenticated Camp Layout:**
    *   Created the `(camp)` route group directory (`src/app/(camp)/`).
    *   Created `src/app/(camp)/layout.tsx` and integrated the `Header` and `Sidebar` components to form the main structure for authenticated views. Footer usage was commented out for now.
    *   Resolved linter error for unused Footer import.

4.  **Profile Page Structure & Components:**
    *   Created the dynamic route structure `src/app/(camp)/[camp_id]/profile/` and the `page.tsx` file.
    *   Created feature component files: `ProfileForm.tsx`, `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`, `AccommodationForm.tsx` in `src/components/features/profile/`.
    *   Added required Shadcn components (`Card`, `Label`, `Input`, `Separator`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Textarea`) via CLI.
    *   Implemented the UI structure for each form using the corresponding Shadcn components for layout and inputs.
    *   Composed the `ProfilePage` to display the three forms, separated by a `Separator`.

5.  **Initial Data Population (Mock):**
    *   Added `useState` to each of the three form components (`ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, `AccommodationForm`).
    *   Defined mock data objects within each component.
    *   Initialized state with mock data and bound state values to the respective form inputs (Input, Select, Checkbox, Textarea) using the `value` or `checked` props.
    *   Implemented basic `onChange` / `onCheckedChange` / `onValueChange` handlers to update the local state (actual saving deferred to Sprint 3).
    *   Added basic `onSubmit` handlers with `console.log` to verify data capture.
    *   Resolved linter/type error related to `Checkbox` `checked` prop type.

## Deviations & Issues Encountered

*   Minor linter errors (unused imports, type mismatches for Checkbox) were encountered during component creation and promptly fixed.
*   Shell escaping issue with `mkdir` for dynamic route required using quotes.

## Sprint Outcome

Sprint 2 successfully achieved its goal. The core application layout (Header, Sidebar) is implemented and integrated within the `(camp)` route group. The Profile page (`/[camp_id]/profile`) renders correctly, displaying the three defined forms (`ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, `AccommodationForm`) built with Shadcn UI components. These forms are populated with initial mock data managed by local `useState`.

The project is now ready to proceed with Sprint 3: Profile Feature Completion & Form Handling.
