# Sprint 12: Frontend Polish, Testing & Refinement - Tasks

**Goal:** Perform thorough testing, refine UI/UX consistency, improve responsiveness, and clean up code before the frontend-only v1.0 release.

**Directory Focus:** `pcb-app/src/`, `specs/` (for reference)

---

## Task Breakdown:

**1. Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing:** Manually test all major features (Profile, Roster, Announcements, Lists, Dashboard, Settings) on latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (if possible).
    *   [ ] **Responsive Design Testing:** Verify layout and usability across common viewports (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile - using browser dev tools).
    *   [ ] **User Flow Testing:** Step through key user flows outlined in `specs/ux_flow.md` using the current mock data implementation. Document any deviations or issues.

**2. UI/UX Refinement & Consistency:**
    *   [ ] **Design System Adherence:** Review all components and pages against `specs/design_spec.md` and the Sprint 5 polish goals. Ensure consistent use of typography, spacing, color palette (neutrals + accents), and component styles (minimal shadows/borders).
    *   [ ] **Component States:** Verify consistent and clear visual states (hover, focus, active, disabled) for interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, list items), ensuring they align with the minimal aesthetic.
    *   [x] **Loading/Feedback States:** Implement subtle loading indicators for form submissions or actions that involve mock delays (e.g., disable submit button, show spinner/text change).

**3. Code Quality & Cleanup:**
    *   [x] **Component Refactoring:** Identify opportunities to refactor complex components for better readability, maintainability, or reusability. (Self-review or pair review).
    *   [x] **Code Cleanup:** Remove any console.logs used for debugging, commented-out code blocks, or unused variables/imports.

**4. Accessibility Review:**
    *   [x] **Keyboard Navigation:** Test navigating through all interactive elements using the Tab key. Ensure logical focus order.
    *   [x] **Focus Visibility:** Confirm that focused elements have clear visual indicators (outlines).
    *   [x] **Semantic HTML:** Briefly review component structure for appropriate use of semantic HTML elements (headings, lists, buttons, etc.).

**5. Sprint Documentation & Wrap-up:**
    *   [x] Update Progress: Maintain `sprints/sprint_12/sprint_12_updates.md`.
    *   [x] Log Issues: Record any technical debt or backlog items found during testing/refinement in `sprints/tech_debt.md` or `sprints/backlog.md`.
    *   [x] Create Report: Upon completion, summarize the sprint in `sprints/sprint_12/sprint_12_report.md`.
