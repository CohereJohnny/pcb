# Sprint 3 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Make the Profile page fully interactive using local state and form validation.

**Sprint Dates:** [Specify Start Date] - [Specify End Date]

## Summary

Sprint 3 focused on integrating form handling and validation into the existing Profile page components (`ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, `AccommodationForm`). The primary goal was achieved, although significant portions of the form integration (using `react-hook-form` and `zod`) were discovered to be already implemented.

The main efforts involved:

1.  **Dependency Installation:** Added `react-hook-form`, `zod`, and `@hookform/resolvers`.
2.  **Schema Definition & Reconciliation:** Created `profileSchema.ts` and defined Zod schemas. Updated these schemas significantly to match the fields and validation logic already present in the form components, including handling `DatePicker` integration and resolving type mismatches.
3.  **Verification of Existing Work:** Confirmed that form integration (`useForm`, `zodResolver`, field registration, error display) was already present in all three profile forms.
4.  **API Route Verification:** Confirmed that the `/api/profile` route already had `GET` and `PUT` handlers using Supabase for data fetching and persistence, exceeding the sprint goal of *simulated* persistence.
5.  **Mutation Hook Verification:** Confirmed the `useProfileMutations` hook correctly interacts with the API and is used by the forms.
6.  **User Feedback Implementation:** Added user feedback using `sonner` toasts for success and error states upon form submission in all three profile forms.
7.  **UI & Navigation Review:** Reviewed the Profile page layout and navigation links, finding the structure reasonable and links correctly implemented.

## Completed Tasks

*   Installed `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`.
*   Created `profileSchema.ts` and defined/updated Zod schemas for all profile forms.
*   Verified existing `react-hook-form` integration in `ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, `AccommodationForm`.
*   Verified existing API route (`/api/profile`) handlers for `GET` and `PUT` using Supabase.
*   Verified existing `useProfileMutations` hook and its usage in forms.
*   Added toast notifications for form submission feedback.
*   Reviewed Profile page layout and navigation.

## Observations & Challenges

*   Significant overlap with previously completed work required updating schemas and verifying existing implementations rather than building from scratch.
*   Type mismatches between Zod schemas, inferred types, and `react-hook-form` required careful schema adjustments (e.g., `.partial()`, date preprocessing, handling defaults).
*   Confusion regarding sprint documentation commits vs. submodule code commits led to minor Git workflow corrections.

## Outcome

The Profile page forms are now fully interactive, validated using Zod, and provide user feedback upon submission. Data is persisted via the `/api/profile` endpoint (using Supabase, exceeding the original scope of local state/simulation). The foundation for profile management is robust.
