# Sprint 3 Updates - 2025-08-01

*   Installed dependencies: `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`.
*   Created `src/lib/validators/profileSchema.ts`.
*   Defined initial Zod schemas and types (`profileFormSchema`, `travelItinerarySchema`, `accommodationSchema`, etc.).
*   **Observation:** Discovered that `ProfileForm.tsx`, `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`, and `AccommodationForm.tsx` already had full `react-hook-form` and `zodResolver` integration implemented.
*   Updated the Zod schemas in `profileSchema.ts` to accurately reflect the fields and validation logic currently used in the existing form components.
*   Marked corresponding tasks in `sprint_3_tasks.md` as complete.
