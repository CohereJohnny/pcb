# Sprint 3 Updates - 2025-08-01

*   Installed dependencies: `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`.
*   Created `src/lib/validators/profileSchema.ts`.
*   Defined initial Zod schemas and types (`profileFormSchema`, `travelItinerarySchema`, `accommodationSchema`, etc.).
*   **Observation:** Discovered that `ProfileForm.tsx`, `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`, and `AccommodationForm.tsx` already had full `react-hook-form` and `zodResolver` integration implemented.
*   Updated the Zod schemas in `profileSchema.ts` to accurately reflect the fields and validation logic currently used in the existing form components.
*   **Observation:** Verified that the `/api/profile` route already had `GET` and `PUT` handlers implemented using Supabase for data fetching and persistence.
*   **Observation:** Verified that the `useProfileMutations` hook correctly calls the `PUT /api/profile` endpoint and is used by the form `onSubmit` handlers.
*   Installed `sonner` and added `<Toaster />` to root layout.
*   Added success/error toast notifications to `onSubmit` handlers in `ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, and `AccommodationForm`.
*   Fixed type errors in `TravelItineraryForm` and `AccommodationForm` related to Zod schema inference and `react-hook-form` integration.
*   Marked corresponding tasks in `sprint_3_tasks.md` as complete.

*   Reviewed Profile page layout (`page.tsx`) - structure deemed reasonable (vertical stack of Cards).
*   Reviewed `Sidebar.tsx` - confirmed correct link construction for Profile page.
*   Navigation flow appears correct based on code review.
*   Marked UI Refinement & Navigation tasks as complete in `sprint_3_tasks.md`.

*   **Blocker Resolution:** Added temporary development auth bypass in `/api/profile` route (GET & PUT) using `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` to allow testing profile page without login. Uses mock user ID `'mock-dev-user'` locally.
