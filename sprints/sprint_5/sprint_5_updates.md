# Sprint 5 Updates

**Date:** 2025-04-12

*   **Task 1.1 (Review Design Spec):** Completed. Reviewed design principles: Notion-inspired, neutral palette (Slate), specific accents, clean typography, ample spacing, minimal borders/shadows.
*   **Task 1.2 (Update Tailwind Config):** Completed. Updated `pcb-app/tailwind.config.js` to use Shadcn CSS variables for colors/radius, set Inter font via variable, and kept existing plugins/animations. Ignored linter errors for `require()`.
*   **Task 1.3 (Update Global CSS):** Completed. Updated `pcb-app/src/app/globals.css` with HSL color variables for light/dark themes (Slate, Teal, Amber) and base body styles.
*   **Task 2.1 (Refactor Header):** Completed. Updated styles in `Header.tsx` for background, border, container padding, and typography.
*   **Task 2.2 (Refactor Sidebar):** Completed. Updated styles in `Sidebar.tsx` for background, border, nav links (inc. placeholder active state). Logged tech debt for making active link fully dynamic.
*   **Task 2.3 (Refactor Footer):** Completed. Updated styles in `Footer.tsx` for background, border, and text color.
*   **Task 2.4 (Review Camp Layout):** Completed. Reviewed `(camp)/layout.tsx`. Existing padding (`p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8`) deemed sufficient for now.
*   **Task 3.1 (Update Profile Page):** Completed. Adjusted title/description styles and spacing on the main profile page.
*   **Task 3.2 (Update ProfileForm):** Completed. Increased spacing and adjusted footer style in `ProfileForm.tsx`.
*   **Task 3.3 (Update TravelItineraryForm):** Completed. Increased spacing and adjusted footer style in `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`. Logged tech debt for DatePicker type errors.
*   **Task 3.4 (Update AccommodationForm):** Completed. Increased spacing and adjusted footer style in `AccommodationForm.tsx`.
*   **Task 4.1 (Update Roster Page):** Completed. Adjusted title/description styles and spacing on the main roster page.
*   **Task 4.2 (Update RosterTable):** Completed. Refined table header/cell/row styles (padding, colors, hover) in `RosterTable.tsx`.
*   **Task 5.1 (Review Component States):** Completed. Reviewed states (hover, focus, active, disabled) for Buttons, Inputs, Links, Table Rows. Appear consistent with theme via Shadcn defaults and explicit styles.
*   **Task 5.2 (Responsive Design Check):** Completed. Manually checked Profile and Roster pages on different screen sizes. Layouts, readability, and usability appear acceptable for now.
*   **Task 5.3 (Optional - Create Custom Primitives):** Skipped. No immediate need identified for custom reusable components based on current features.
*   **Task 6.1 (Accessibility Review):** Completed. Basic review of color contrast (seems reasonable with Slate/Teal/Amber) and keyboard navigation/focus states (relying on Shadcn/Radix defaults). No major issues noted for now.
*   **Task 6.2 (Cross-Browser Check):** Completed. Manually checked Profile/Roster pages in different browsers. No major rendering inconsistencies reported.
