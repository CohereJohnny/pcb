# Sprint 7 Updates

**Date:** 2025-04-12

*   **Task 1 (Install Husky & Lint-Staged):** Completed. Ensured `husky` and `lint-staged` are installed in `pcb-app`. Ran `pnpm dlx husky init` successfully, creating the `.husky/` directory within `pcb-app`.
*   **Task 2 (Configure Lint-Staged):** Completed. Added `lint-staged` configuration to `pcb-app/package.json` to run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged `.ts`/`.tsx` files.
*   **Task 3 (Create Pre-Commit Hook):** Completed. Updated `pcb-app/.husky/pre-commit` to execute `npx lint-staged`.
*   **Task 4 (Test Pre-Commit Hook):** Completed. Successfully tested the hook by making a change, staging it, and running `git commit` *within* the `pcb-app` directory. Lint-staged executed as expected.
*   **Task 5 (Create Workflow Dir):** Completed. Created the `.github/workflows` directory in the project root.
*   **Task 6 (Create CI Workflow):** Completed. Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with steps to checkout, setup pnpm/node, install dependencies, lint, and build within the `pcb-app` directory.
*   **Task 7 (Vercel Integration):** Pending user action. User needs to connect the GitHub repo to Vercel, configure the Root Directory (`pcb-app`), build/install commands (`pnpm build`/`pnpm install`), and confirm deployment settings. User confirmed settings are configured.
*   **Task 8 (Verify CI/CD):** Completed. User pushed `test-ci-cd` branch, created PR, verified GitHub Action ran successfully for PR and merge to `main`. Verified Vercel preview and production deployments triggered automatically and succeeded.
