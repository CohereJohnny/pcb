# Sprint 7 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Automate testing (linting), building, and deployment using Husky, lint-staged, GitHub Actions, and Vercel integration.

**Date Completed:** 2025-04-12

**Summary:**

This sprint successfully established the foundational CI/CD pipeline for the `pcb-app` project. All planned tasks were completed, automating key development and deployment workflows.

**Key accomplishments include:**

*   **Pre-Commit Hooks:**
    *   Installed Husky and lint-staged within the `pcb-app` directory.
    *   Configured lint-staged via `package.json` to run ESLint (`--fix`) and Prettier (`--write`) on staged `.ts`/`.tsx` files.
    *   Configured the Husky pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) to execute `npx lint-staged`.
    *   Successfully tested the pre-commit hook, verifying that linting and formatting run automatically before commits within `pcb-app`.
*   **GitHub Actions CI Workflow:**
    *   Created the `.github/workflows` directory structure in the project root.
    *   Implemented a CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
    *   The workflow checks out code, sets up the correct pnpm and Node.js versions (with caching), installs dependencies, runs the linter (`pnpm lint`), and builds the application (`pnpm build`), ensuring all commands target the `pcb-app` directory.
*   **Vercel Integration & Pipeline Verification:**
    *   User confirmed manual Vercel configuration (linking GitHub repo, setting root directory to `pcb-app`, confirming build commands and deployment triggers).
    *   Verified the end-to-end pipeline by creating a test branch (`test-ci-cd`), pushing a change, opening a Pull Request, and merging to `main`.
    *   Confirmed the GitHub Action ran successfully on both the PR and the merge.
    *   Confirmed Vercel automatically created a preview deployment for the PR and a production deployment upon merging to `main`.

**Outcome:**
A functional CI/CD pipeline is now in place. Pre-commit hooks enforce code style and quality within the `pcb-app` repository. Automated checks (linting, building) run on GitHub for pushes and PRs to the `main` branch. Vercel automatically deploys preview and production builds based on PRs and merges to `main`.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed with Sprint 8 (List Management UI - Core & Viewing).
