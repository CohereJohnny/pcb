# Sprint 8 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the UI for viewing lists (overview and basic single view) and creating new lists using mock data and local state (Zustand), applying the established design system.

**Date Completed:** 2025-04-12

**Summary:**
This sprint successfully implemented the foundational UI for the List Management feature. Users can now view an overview of lists, navigate to a form to create new lists, and view a basic detail page for a single list. The implementation uses mock data managed by a dedicated Zustand store.

**Key accomplishments include:**

*   **Data Definitions:** Added `List` and `ListItem` interfaces to `types/dataModel.ts`. Created list type constants in `lib/constants/listTypes.ts`.
*   **Mock Data & State:** Created mock lists and list items in `lib/mockData/lists.ts`. Implemented `useListStore` (Zustand) to manage this mock data, including `addList` and `addListItem` actions.
*   **Routing:** Established routes for list overview (`/(list)`), creation (`/new`), and single view (`/[list_id]`) under `(camp)/[camp_id]/lists/`.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Created `ListCard` component to display list summaries, using Shadcn `Card` and `Badge`.
    *   Created `ListOverview` component to display `ListCard` components in a responsive grid.
    *   Created `lists` Zod validator (`lib/validators/lists.ts`).
    *   Created `ListForm` component using RHF, Zod, and Shadcn components (`Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`) for list creation.
    *   Added the Shadcn `Badge` component to the project.
*   **Page Implementation:** Integrated the components and Zustand store into the corresponding list overview, new list, and single list view pages.
*   **Integration:** Ensured components adhere to the design system and confirmed the "Lists" navigation link exists in the Sidebar.

**Outcome:**
The core UI for viewing and creating lists is functional using mock data. Users can navigate the list section, see existing mock lists, create new lists (which are added to the local Zustand store), and view a basic placeholder page for individual lists.

**Potential Issues/Notes:**
*   Linter errors related to path resolution for validators (`src/lib/validators/*.ts`) were observed but did not impede functionality in the test environment. This might require revisiting `tsconfig.json` if issues arise in different contexts.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed with Sprint 9 (List Management UI - Item Interaction & Tasks).
*   Conduct testing based on the `sprint_8_testplan.md`.
