# Sprint 3 Report: Profile Feature Completion & Form Handling

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-11
**Sprint Goal:** Make the Profile page fully interactive using local state and form validation.

---

## Summary of Activities

Sprint 3 focused on integrating form management and validation into the User Profile feature components built in Sprint 2.

1.  **Dependencies:**
    *   Installed `react-hook-form`, `zod`, and `@hookform/resolvers` using npm.

2.  **Validation Schemas:**
    *   Created `src/lib/validators/profileSchema.ts`.
    *   Defined and exported `profileFormSchema`, `travelItinerarySchema`, and `accommodationSchema` using Zod.
    *   **Deviation/Tech Debt:** Simplified date handling (`arrival_date`, `departure_date`) in `travelItinerarySchema` to use `z.string()` instead of preprocessed `z.date()` due to persistent type conflicts between Zod preprocessing and RHF/HTML input types. Logged tech debt to revisit this.
    *   **Deviation:** Simplified `power_amps` validation in `accommodationSchema` (removed `preprocess`) to resolve type conflicts, relying on `valueAsNumber` during registration.

3.  **React Hook Form & Zod Integration:**
    *   Refactored `ProfileForm.tsx`, `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`, and `AccommodationForm.tsx`.
    *   Removed previous `useState`-based form handling.
    *   Imported and configured `useForm` hook with `zodResolver` and appropriate schemas.
    *   Used `register` for standard `Input` and `Textarea` elements.
    *   Used RHF's `<Controller>` component to wrap Shadcn `Select` and `Checkbox` components for proper state integration.
    *   Updated `onSubmit` handlers in each form to accept the validated `data` argument provided by RHF's `handleSubmit`.
    *   Implemented simulated async behavior and `isSubmitting` state for form buttons.
    *   Used `watch` in `AccommodationForm` to dynamically disable the `power_amps` input based on the `power_needs` checkbox.

4.  **Mock Save Logic:**
    *   Kept `onSubmit` handlers logging data to the console.
    *   Added comments indicating where actual state updates (e.g., to context or API call) would occur later.

5.  **Validation Feedback:**
    *   Accessed the `errors` object from `formState` in each form component.
    *   Added simple conditional rendering (`<p>`) below relevant inputs to display validation error messages from Zod via RHF.

6.  **UI & Navigation Refinement:**
    *   Reviewed Profile page layout (`page.tsx`); structure deemed acceptable for now.
    *   Verified the `Sidebar.tsx` component correctly generates the link (`/{campId}/profile`) for the Profile page.

## Deviations & Issues Encountered

*   **Date Validation Complexity:** Encountered significant type conflicts between Zod's date preprocessing and RHF/HTML date input expectations. Simplified schema to use strings for dates as a workaround for this sprint. **Logged as Tech Debt.**
*   **Number Input Validation Complexity:** Similar type conflicts arose with Zod's `preprocess` for number inputs (`power_amps`). Simplified schema and used RHF's `valueAsNumber` option during registration.
*   **Boolean Default Complexity:** Type conflicts occurred with Zod's `.default()` for boolean fields (`power_needs`) interacting with RHF. Resolved by removing `.default()` from schema and ensuring explicit boolean in `defaultValues`.

## Sprint Outcome

Sprint 3 successfully achieved its goal. The three forms on the Profile page are now fully managed by `react-hook-form`, leveraging `zod` schemas for validation. Users receive feedback on validation errors, and submitting valid forms logs the structured data. The forms handle default values and simulate submission states.

The Profile feature is now functionally complete from a frontend/local state perspective for the MVP.

The project is ready to proceed with Sprint 4: Roster UI & Basic Vercel Deployment.
