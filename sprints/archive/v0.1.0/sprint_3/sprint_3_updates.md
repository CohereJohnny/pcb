# Sprint 3 Updates

*   Installed `react-hook-form`, `zod`, and `@hookform/resolvers` dependencies.
*   Created `src/lib/validators/profileSchema.ts` and defined Zod schemas: `profileFormSchema`, `travelItinerarySchema` (simplified date validation), `accommodationSchema` (simplified power_amps validation).
*   Refactored `ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, and `AccommodationForm` to use `react-hook-form` and `zodResolver`.
*   Utilized `register` and `Controller` for inputs.
*   Updated `onSubmit` handlers to accept validated data and simulate save.
*   Added validation error message display below relevant fields.
*   Reviewed Profile page layout and verified Sidebar navigation link.
*   Logged tech debt for simplified date validation.
*   Sprint 3 tasks complete.
