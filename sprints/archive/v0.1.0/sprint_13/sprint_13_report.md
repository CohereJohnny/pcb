# Sprint 13 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Finalize documentation, perform final checks, and prepare the frontend-only MVP for a nominal v0.1.0 release.

**Date Range:** [Insert Start Date] - [Insert End Date]

---

## Summary of Work Completed:

*   **Documentation:**
    *   Significantly updated `pcb-app/README.md` with comprehensive sections covering project overview, MVP features, tech stack, setup, development, and deployment instructions.
    *   Added JSDoc comments to the `processRosterData` utility function for clarity.
*   **Final Checks & Cleanup:**
    *   Confirmed `.env*` files are correctly ignored in `.gitignore` and documented README regarding environment variable usage.
    *   Performed final code cleanup, removing remaining commented-out logs and unused code artifacts (with noted exceptions in `profile/page.tsx` and `Header.tsx`).
    *   Reviewed mock data files (`roster.ts`, etc.) for reasonableness.
    *   User confirmed completion of final smoke testing on Vercel deployment.
*   **Release Preparation:**
    *   Successfully created and pushed the annotated Git tag `v0.1.0` to mark the frontend MVP release.
*   **Sprint Process:**
    *   Maintained `sprint_13_updates.md`.
    *   No new issues logged for `tech_debt.md` or `backlog.md`.

## Outcomes:

*   The project documentation (`README.md`) is substantially improved, providing essential information for developers and users.
*   Codebase is cleaned and prepared for the v0.1.0 milestone.
*   Frontend MVP release `v0.1.0` officially tagged in Git.

## Notes/Issues Encountered:

*   Minor difficulty removing some commented-out code from `Header.tsx` via tooling; left in place for now.
*   Decision made to tag this release as `v0.1.0` instead of `v1.0.0` to better reflect its frontend-only MVP status.
