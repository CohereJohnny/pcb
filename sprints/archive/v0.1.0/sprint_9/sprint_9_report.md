# Sprint 9 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Enable adding, viewing, editing, and completing items within a list, using mock data and local state. Implement task-specific fields and display variations.

**Date Completed:** 2025-04-13

**Summary:**
This sprint successfully added interactivity to the List Management feature. All core implementation tasks were completed. Users can now add items to lists, mark items as complete, and view task-specific details like assignees, due dates, and statuses. A basic widget for viewing assigned tasks was also created.

**Key accomplishments include:**

*   **Data Model & Mock Data:**
    *   Extended the `ListItem` interface with optional task fields (`assignee_user_id`, `due_date`, `status`).
    *   Defined task status constants (`lib/constants/taskStatus.ts`).
    *   Updated mock list items for TASK lists to include the new fields.
*   **State Management (`useListStore`):**
    *   Added `updateListItem` and `toggleItemComplete` actions to the Zustand store for item manipulation.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Created `ListItemDisplay` to render individual items, including conditional display of task details (assignee, due date, status badge) and a functional completion `Checkbox` linked to the store action.
    *   Created `ListItemList` to display a list of `ListItemDisplay` components.
    *   Added `listItemSchema` to `lib/validators/lists.ts` for item content validation.
    *   Created `AddItemForm` as an inline form using RHF/Zod for adding new items to a list, linked to the `addListItem` store action.
*   **Page Enhancements:**
    *   Updated the Single List View page (`/[list_id]/page.tsx`) to display the list of items using `ListItemList` and include the `AddItemForm`.
*   **Dashboard Widget:**
    *   Created the `AssignedTasksWidget` component, which filters and displays incomplete tasks assigned to the mock current user.
*   **Styling & Integration:** Confirmed adherence to the design system and acknowledged user testing on Vercel.

**Deferred Items:**
*   Inline editing of list item content was deferred as a stretch goal. (Consider adding to backlog).

**Outcome:**
Users can now interact with list items: add new items via a form, mark items complete using checkboxes, and view specific details for task-type items. The data updates are reflected via the Zustand store. The basic data for a "My Tasks" view is available through the new widget.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed with Sprint 10 (Dashboard Implementation & Roster Management UI).
*   Integrate the `AssignedTasksWidget` onto the actual Dashboard page in Sprint 10.
*   Conduct testing based on the `sprint_9_testplan.md`.
*   Add deferred "Inline list item content editing" to `backlog.md` if desired.
