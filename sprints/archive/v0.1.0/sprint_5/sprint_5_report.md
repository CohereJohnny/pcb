# Sprint 5 Report: Design System Implementation & UI Polish

**Sprint Goal:** Refine the overall look and feel, implement the design language consistently across existing components (Profile, Roster), aiming for a clean, Notion-like aesthetic while adhering to the updated `design_spec.md`.

**Sprint Dates:** 2025-04-12

**Status:** Completed

---

## Summary of Activities:

1.  **Theme Foundation:**
    *   Reviewed `design_spec.md` for Notion-inspired principles (neutral palette, clean typography, spacing, minimal elements).
    *   Updated `tailwind.config.js` to use Shadcn CSS variables for colors/radius and set the Inter font via `--font-sans`.
    *   Updated `globals.css` with new HSL color variables (Slate, Teal, Amber) for light/dark themes and applied base body styles (font, line-height).

2.  **Core Layout Refinement:**
    *   Refactored `Header.tsx`: Applied theme colors, adjusted padding/typography.
    *   Refactored `Sidebar.tsx`: Applied theme colors, updated nav link styles (including hover), adjusted spacing. Logged tech debt for dynamic active link styling (requires client component).
    *   Refactored `Footer.tsx`: Applied theme colors and text styles.
    *   Reviewed `(camp)/layout.tsx`: Confirmed existing padding provides adequate whitespace.

3.  **Feature Component Polish (Profile):**
    *   Polished Profile page title/description styles and spacing.
    *   Increased spacing within `ProfileForm.tsx`, `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`, and `AccommodationForm.tsx` (content padding, label/input spacing, grid gaps).
    *   Added border and padding to `CardFooter` in all profile forms for consistency.
    *   Logged tech debt for `react-datepicker` type errors encountered in `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`.

4.  **Feature Component Polish (Roster):**
    *   Polished Roster page title/description styles and spacing.
    *   Refined `RosterTable.tsx` styles: adjusted header/cell padding, typography, borders, and added subtle row hover effect.

5.  **Consistency & Responsiveness:**
    *   Reviewed interactive component states (buttons, inputs, links, table rows) for visual consistency with the theme.
    *   Manually performed responsive design checks on Profile and Roster pages; layouts adapt acceptably across screen sizes.
    *   Skipped optional task to create custom primitives as no immediate need was identified.

6.  **Accessibility & Final Checks:**
    *   Performed a basic review of color contrast and keyboard navigation/focus states; deemed acceptable based on theme and Shadcn defaults.
    *   Manually performed cross-browser checks; no major inconsistencies reported.

7.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Resolved `Module not found` errors for `tailwindcss-animate` and `react-datepicker` by cleaning up the project root directory (removing stray `node_modules`/`package.json`) and correctly installing the dependencies within the `pcb-app` directory using `pnpm`.
    *   Documented the fix in `bug_swatting.md`.

## Outcome:

The application's visual appearance now more closely aligns with the Notion-inspired design specification. Core layout and existing feature components (Profile, Roster) have been updated with the Slate-based neutral theme, refined typography, improved spacing, and consistent styling using Shadcn CSS variables. Basic responsiveness and accessibility checks were performed. Key issues encountered (dependency installation, DatePicker types, Sidebar active state) were either resolved or logged as technical debt.

The codebase is prepared for the next sprint focusing on new feature implementation (Announcements).

## Notes / Issues Logged:

*   **Tech Debt:**
    *   Sidebar active link styling requires Client Component.
    *   Type errors with `react-datepicker` and `Controller` in `TravelItineraryForm.tsx`.
*   **Backlog:** None added this sprint.
