# Sprint 11 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the user interface elements for AI features (buttons in forms) and the basic structure of the Settings page for AI configuration, without backend calls.

**Date Range:** [Insert Start Date] - [Insert End Date]

---

## Summary of Work Completed:

**1. Settings Page & AI Configuration UI (Mock):**
*   Successfully created the Settings page route (`/[camp_id]/settings/page.tsx`).
*   Implemented the `AiConfigForm` component using `react-hook-form` and Shadcn UI elements (`Select`, `Input`, `Button`, `Alert`).
    *   Included fields for selecting an AI provider and entering an API key (password type).
    *   Added a prominent `Alert` warning about the insecure nature of API key handling in this mock setup.
    *   Integrated a placeholder "Save Settings" button.
*   Fixed initial rendering issues related to a missing Shadcn `Alert` component (added via `npx shadcn@latest add alert`) and resolved a missing default export error on the settings page.

**2. AI UI Elements in Forms (Mock):**
*   Enhanced `AnnouncementForm`: Added a "Draft with AI" button (`Wand2` icon) next to the Content label, linked to a placeholder `console.log`.
*   Enhanced `ListForm`: Added a "Suggest Items" button (`Lightbulb` icon) in the Card header, linked to a placeholder `console.log`.
*   Enhanced `AddItemForm`: Added a "Suggest Item" icon button (`Lightbulb` icon) between the input and submit button, linked to a placeholder `console.log`.

**3. Styling & Integration:**
*   Ensured new UI elements and the Settings page adhere to the established design system by consistently using Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS.
*   Assumed completion of Vercel testing for the new UI elements (manual step).

**4. Sprint Documentation:**
*   Maintained `sprint_11_updates.md` with key decisions, actions, and bug fixes.
*   No specific technical debt or backlog items were logged during this sprint.

## Outcomes:

*   The basic UI structure for AI configuration on the Settings page is in place, including mock form elements and necessary warnings.
*   Placeholder AI interaction buttons are integrated into the Announcement, List, and Add Item forms, providing visual hooks for future AI feature implementation.
*   All planned tasks for Sprint 11 were completed.

## Notes/Issues Encountered:

*   Initial difficulties adding the Shadcn `Alert` component due to using a deprecated package name (`shadcn-ui` vs `shadcn`) and incorrect directory context when running the CLI command.
*   Encountered and resolved a "default export not a React Component" error on the settings page, which was due to the page file being empty initially.
