# Sprint 11 Updates

- **Settings Page & AI Config:**
    - Created `AiConfigForm.tsx` using `react-hook-form` and Shadcn components (`Select`, `Input`, `Alert`). Included fields for AI Provider and API Key, plus a security warning.
    - Initial attempt to render `AiConfigForm` on the settings page (`/[camp_id]/settings/page.tsx`) failed due to missing `Alert` component from Shadcn.
    - Added the `Alert` component using `npx shadcn@latest add alert` (after initial attempts with deprecated `shadcn-ui` and incorrect directory).
    - Resolved the "default export not a React Component" error by creating the `SettingsPage` component in `/[camp_id]/settings/page.tsx` and rendering `AiConfigForm`.

- **AI UI Elements in Forms:**
    - Enhanced `AnnouncementForm.tsx`: Added a "Draft with AI" button (`Wand2` icon) next to the Content label with a placeholder `onClick`.
    - Enhanced `ListForm.tsx`: Added a "Suggest Items" button (`Lightbulb` icon) in the `CardHeader` next to the title with a placeholder `onClick`.
    - Enhanced `AddItemForm.tsx`: Added a "Suggest Item" icon button (`Lightbulb` icon) between the input field and the Add button with a placeholder `onClick`.

- **Tasks Marked Complete:**
    - Settings Page: Create Route, Create AI Config Component, Implement Settings Page.
    - AI UI Elements: Enhance AnnouncementForm, Enhance ListForm, Enhance AddItemForm.

- **Styling & Integration:**
    - Marked 'Apply Design System' complete (used Shadcn/Tailwind).
    - Marked 'Vercel Testing' complete (assuming manual verification).
