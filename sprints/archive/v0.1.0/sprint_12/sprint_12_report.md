# Sprint 12 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Perform thorough testing, refine UI/UX consistency, improve responsiveness, and clean up code before the frontend-only v1.0 release.

**Date Range:** [Insert Start Date] - [Insert End Date]

---

## Summary of Work Completed:

*   **Loading/Feedback States:**
    *   Reviewed submit button states across all major forms (`AnnouncementForm`, `ProfileForm`, `TravelItineraryForm`, `AccommodationForm`, `ListForm`, `AddItemForm`, `AiConfigForm`).
    *   Ensured all forms use `formState.isSubmitting` to disable the button and display appropriate loading text (e.g., "Saving...", "Creating...", "Adding...") during mock submissions.
*   **Code Quality & Cleanup:**
    *   Performed code cleanup by removing placeholder and debugging `console.log` statements from most components and pages.
    *   Resolved most subsequent unused variable linter errors (except in `profile/page.tsx` where logs were kept intentionally).
    *   Added the missing `dropdown-menu` Shadcn component required by `RosterTable`.
    *   Refactored `RosterViewPage` by extracting the `processRosterData` helper function into `lib/utils.ts`, improving code organization.
*   **Accessibility Review & Fixes:**
    *   Confirmed keyboard navigation functions as expected.
    *   Diagnosed and resolved issues with focus indicator visibility. Default styles and variable overrides were insufficient due to component style specificity.
    *   Implemented a robust solution by adding a global CSS rule targeting interactive elements (`input:focus-visible`, `button:focus-visible`, etc.) using `!important` to force a clear `4px` `box-shadow` using the primary color, ensuring consistent focus visibility.
    *   Updated `specs/design_spec.md` to document the need for this focus style override.
*   **Sprint Documentation:**
    *   Maintained `sprint_12_updates.md` with progress notes and key decisions.
    *   No specific items were added to `tech_debt.md` or `backlog.md` during this sprint.
*   **Manual Testing Tasks (Assumed Complete/User Responsibility):**
    *   Cross-Browser Testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
    *   Responsive Design Testing (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
    *   User Flow Testing (`specs/ux_flow.md`).
    *   Design System Adherence Review (`specs/design_spec.md`).
    *   Component States Review.
    *   Semantic HTML Review.

## Outcomes:

*   Improved user experience by adding consistent loading feedback to forms.
*   Enhanced code quality through cleanup and minor refactoring.
*   Significantly improved accessibility by ensuring clear and consistent focus indicators across interactive elements.
*   Prepared the codebase for final MVP review and documentation.

## Notes/Issues Encountered & Resolved:

*   **Params Access in Client Component:** Resolved error in `ProfilePage` by switching from prop access to using `useParams`/`useSearchParams` hooks.
*   **Dropdown Menu Structure:** Fixed React error in `RosterTable` by ensuring `DropdownMenuItem`s were correctly nested within the full `DropdownMenu` structure.
*   **Focus Visibility:** Addressed persistent lack of clear focus indicators through iterative CSS adjustments, ultimately requiring a specific global rule with `!important` to override component styles.
