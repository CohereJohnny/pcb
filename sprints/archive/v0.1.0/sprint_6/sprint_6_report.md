# Sprint 6 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the UI for creating, viewing (list), and displaying single announcements using mock data and local state (Zustand), consistent with the refined design system.

**Date Completed:** 2025-04-12

**Summary:**

This sprint successfully delivered the core UI functionality for the Announcements feature within the Theme Camp Hub application. All planned tasks were completed.

**Key accomplishments include:**

*   **Data Modeling & Mock Data:** Defined the `Announcement` TypeScript interface and created mock data (`lib/mockData/announcements.ts`) along with helper functions.
*   **Local State Management:** Implemented a Zustand store (`store/announcementStore.ts`) to manage the mock announcement data in the browser session, allowing for additions via the form.
*   **Routing:** Established the necessary Next.js App Router routes for listing (`/(list)/page.tsx`), creating (`/new/page.tsx`), and viewing individual announcements (`/[announcement_id]/page.tsx`) under the `(camp)/[camp_id]/announcements` structure.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Created `AnnouncementCard.tsx` to display a summary of each announcement.
    *   Created `AnnouncementList.tsx` to render a collection of `AnnouncementCard` components.
    *   Created `AnnouncementForm.tsx` using Shadcn UI components, `react-hook-form`, and Zod (`lib/validators/announcements.ts`) for creating new announcements. Integrated the `uuid` package for generating unique IDs for new mock entries.
*   **Page Integration:** Integrated the UI components into their respective page routes, connecting them to the Zustand store for data fetching and updates. Implemented navigation between the list, new, and view pages.
*   **Dependencies:** Added `zustand`, `uuid`, `@types/uuid`, and the Shadcn `Form` component.

**Outcome:**
The basic CRUD (Create, Read) operations for announcements are functional using mock data stored locally. Users can view a list of announcements for a specific camp, click to view details, navigate to a form to create a new announcement, and see the new announcement added to the list upon submission.

**Next Steps:**
*   Integrate real data fetching and mutation logic when backend API is available.
*   Implement user authentication to associate authors correctly.
*   Refine styling and potentially add Markdown support for content.
*   Add navigation link to the sidebar (Task 5.2 from tasks).
*   Conduct testing based on the `sprint_6_testplan.md`.
