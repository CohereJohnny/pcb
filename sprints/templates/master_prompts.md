okay lets continue on to sprint 2.  Review @sprintplan.md and give me a detailed and logical breakdown of sprint 2, put everything into @sprint_2_tasks.md .

okay lets continue in building out the project.  once again review @sprint_2_tasks.md  and make updates to @sprint_2_updates.md  as you go.  you should check off tasks in @sprint_2_tasks.md  as you go, but do not modify the plan.  Do not deviate from the plan, instead, add tech debt that is not an immediate priority to @tech_debt.md and non critical feature enhancements or new feature ideas to @backlog.md .  @sprint_2_updates.md  are just notes for me and for you to keep track of current context.  when you are completely done with sprint 1, we will consolidate everything into @sprint_2_report.md  and I will remind you of this in case you forget.

okay lets continue in building out the project.  once again review @sprint_5_tasks.md   and make updates to @sprint_5_updates.md   as you go.  you should check off tasks in @sprint_5_tasks.md   as you go, but do not modify the plan.  Do not deviate from the plan, instead, add tech debt that is not an immediate priority to @tech_debt.md and non critical feature enhancements or new feature ideas to @backlog.md .  @sprint_5_updates.md   are just notes for me and for you to keep track of current context.  when you are completely done with sprint 5, we will consolidate everything into @sprint_5_report.md   and I will remind you of this in case you forget.
