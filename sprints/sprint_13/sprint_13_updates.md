# Sprint 13 Updates

- **Sprint Started:** Created `sprint-13` branch, initialized sprint directory and files.
- **README Update:** Expanded `pcb-app/README.md` with sections for Overview, Features (MVP v1.0), Tech Stack, Setup Instructions, Development Instructions, and Vercel Deployment details.

- **Code Comments:** Added JSDoc comments to `processRosterData` in `lib/utils.ts`. Reviewed `AccommodationForm.tsx` and deemed current logic clear enough without specific comments.

- **Environment Variables:** Confirmed `.env*` is in `.gitignore`. No required env vars for MVP build identified. README instructions cover future usage.

- **Code/Artifact Cleanup:** Removed remaining commented-out console logs and unused parameters (except in profile page and Header). Reviewed mock data files.

- **Final Checks & Release Prep:**
    - Final Vercel testing confirmed complete by user.
    - Created and pushed annotated Git tag `v0.1.0`.
