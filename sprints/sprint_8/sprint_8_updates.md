# Sprint 8 Updates

**Date:** 2025-04-12

*   **Task 1 (Data & Mock):** Completed. Defined `List`, `ListItem` types in `dataModel.ts`. Created `listTypes.ts` constants. Created `mockLists`, `mockListItems` in `lib/mockData/lists.ts` (reusing exported `getPastDate`). Created `useListStore` Zustand store with initial mock data and basic actions (`addList`, `addListItem`).
*   **Task 2 (List Routes):** Completed. Created directory structure and page files for list overview (`/(list)`), new (`/new`), and single view (`/[list_id]`) under `(camp)/[camp_id]/lists/`.
*   **Task 3 (List UI Components):** Completed. Created `ListCard`, `ListOverview`, `lists` validator (`listSchema`), and `ListForm`. Added Shadcn `Badge` component.
*   **Task 4 (Page Implementation):** Completed. Implemented List Overview, New List, and basic Single List View pages, integrating components and Zustand store.
*   **Task 5 (Styling & Integration):** Completed (Tasks 5.1, 5.2). Ensured components follow design system. Sidebar link for "Lists" was already present.
