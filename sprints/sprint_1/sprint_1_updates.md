# Sprint 1 Updates

*   Attempted `pnpm create next-app...` but encountered a `corepack` signature verification error.
*   Retrying project initialization using `npx create-next-app...` as an alternative.
*   `npx create-next-app` command initiated successfully and is running in the background.
*   Changed directory to `pcb-app`.
*   Attempted `pnpm add` for Shadcn dependencies, but encountered the same `corepack` error.
*   Switching to `npm install` for remaining Sprint 1 dependencies as `create-next-app` used npm successfully.
*   Successfully installed Shadcn core, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged using `npm install`.
*   Configured Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`).
*   Created ESLint config (`.eslintrc.json`) with Next.js and Prettier extends.
*   Created Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`) and PostCSS (`postcss.config.js`) configs.
*   Initialized Shadcn using `npx shadcn@latest init`.
*   Configured Husky and lint-staged (prepare script, manual pre-commit hook, `lint-staged.config.js`).
*   Created missing project directories (`components/ui`, `styles`, `types`, `config`, `constants`, `contexts`, `hooks`).
*   Created `src/types/index.ts`.
*   Verified essential files (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `globals.css`, `utils.ts`, `.gitignore`).
*   Updated `README.md` with minimal project info.
*   Staged all files for initial commit.
*   Attempted initial commit, but pre-commit hook failed.
*   Reason: `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` not found (likely missing dev dependency).
*   Reason: Husky pre-commit script header deprecated (minor warning).
*   Installing `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` as dev dependency.
*   Successfully installed `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`.
*   Retried commit and it succeeded. Pre-commit hook ran successfully.
*   Sprint 1 tasks complete.
