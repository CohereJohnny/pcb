# Sprint 10 Report

**Sprint Goal:** Build the Dashboard page by integrating existing widgets and implement the UI for mock Roster management actions (Invite, Edit Role, Remove).

**Date Completed:** 2025-04-13

**Summary:**
This sprint focused on assembling the initial Dashboard page and adding placeholder UI elements for future Roster management features. The Dashboard now provides a central view incorporating previously built widgets.

**Key accomplishments include:**

*   **Dashboard Implementation:**
    *   Created the Dashboard page route (`app/(camp)/[camp_id]/dashboard/page.tsx`).
    *   Created the `RecentAnnouncementsWidget` component to display a summary of the latest announcements from the `useAnnouncementStore`.
    *   Integrated the `RecentAnnouncementsWidget` and the existing `AssignedTasksWidget` (from Sprint 9) onto the Dashboard page using a simple grid layout.
*   **Roster Management UI (Mock):**
    *   Added an "Invite New Member" button to the Roster page (`roster/(view)/page.tsx`) with a placeholder `onClick` handler.
    *   Added an "Actions" column to the `RosterTable` component.
    *   Included placeholder "Edit Role" and "Remove" buttons within the Actions column for each roster member, linked to placeholder `onClick` handlers.
*   **Code Refinement:** Refactored the Roster page component to use mock data directly while retaining client-side capabilities for the new button actions.

**Outcome:**
The Dashboard page is now functional, displaying widgets for recent announcements and assigned tasks based on mock data. Placeholder buttons for Roster management actions (Invite, Edit Role, Remove) are visible on the Roster page, providing UI hooks for future implementation.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed with Sprint 11 (AI Feature UI & Settings UI).
*   Implement actual Roster management functionality (tracked in `backlog.md`).
*   Conduct testing based on the `sprint_10_testplan.md`.
